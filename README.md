# SanGottardo
Plot of a temperature Profile along the trajectory of the San Gotthard Base Tunnel. 
Temperatures were taken with a handheld infrared thermometer ([much like this one](https://www.amazon.com/Infrared-Thermometer-Non-Contact-Digital-Temperature/dp/B07V26XHCG/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=radiation+thermometer&qid=1575117181&sr=8-1)) from a open car window on the roof of the tunnel. Measures were taken for about one second, resulting in a trajectory of roughly 20m after a position sign averaged into one measurement. The elevation profile is taken from [Geocontext](http://www.geocontext.org/publ/2010/04/profiler/en/).
